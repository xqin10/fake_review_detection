      "{'review': <p class=\"partial_entry\">There were six of us who dined here on a Saturday night. We were given a choice of tables and chose a secluded one, to the side of the main entrance and just outside the toilets, as our host had advised that the restaurant was...<span class=\"postSnippet\">going to be full and it could get noisy. It was a good choice in terms of noise however as we were out of the main part of the restaurant we seemed to be a little neglected in terms of service and there was also a minor hiccup in the kitchen which resulted in two of the mains being delayed. The staff though, when we did get their attention, were very friendly.\n",

Between us for starters we had the rainbow trout, the pan seared scallops, the char grilled octopus, vitello tonnato, the aranchini and the veal and pork meatballs. Everyone thought that their choice was excellent. \n",
