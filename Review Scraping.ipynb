Spoke to reception again who informed me that the pool was only reput onto heat recently and it takes 2 weeks for the pool to heat up again.   I had called prior to booking and I explicitly asked is the pool up and running and heated and the person capacity for it and was assured it was and 3 people limit. That the reception did not tell me this the first time I told them it was cold is shameful as I  would've said cancel the booking and found another hotel nearby that had a heated pool.

A 7-8 minute walk to Southern Cross Station and the Tram network, the bus/coach station is across road 5 minutes away. The hotel itself met our needs and was clean and tidy. The reception staff were very helpful. Our bedroom was large with a newish bathroom that had a wet-room for showering. Because this is a business hotel it doesn’t provide much storage space for long stay travellers so most of our clothes stayed in the case. The Wi-fi worked well throughout the hotel and was free. There were about 17 floors but the lifts were fast and efficient to get you to and from your room. The hotel only provides a Continental breakfast option no other meals were available and there’s no bar\\n…', 'review_rating': '3', 'date_of_stay': 'March 2020', 'review_date': 'Andy S wrote a review Mar 2020'}\n"
