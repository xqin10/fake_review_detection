      "{'review': \"Travel to Melbourne 3 or 4 times a year and come here most trips - have been pre and post renovation and really enjoyed the atmosphere and setup both before and after.What surprises me is that coming from Adelaide where we do have some excellent steak venues in the form of Argentinian (Sosta, Gaucho, Buenos Aires etc), is that the steaks are priced on par if not cheaper then the Adelaide equivalent. Considering the Southbank location and excellent quality of food I was expecting far higher prices. Anyway on to the food -Tasting platter is always a excellent entre. I always stick with either the rib eye, pork ribs or the dish which combines both. Always great and on par with the best ribs and steak's i've had anywhere. Only minor complaint last visit is that my side of mash was extremely rich / creamy - too much butter/ cheese I assume. Wasn't like this before so probably a one off. Normally when I visit Southbank its at the start of a night out and I'm with a group having a few drinks. This is where the extensive spirit and wine menu comes in handy - one of the most impressive lists I've come across in a resturant.

The steaks are mammoth and delicious. They also specialize in ribs - lamb, beef and pork. Although you could be mistaken for confusing them for Flintstonesesque dinosaur ribs (they are HUGE).
